Requirements:

//A new book button to get user input to create a new book. This should bring up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book:  author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.
//An object constructor  which takes the user input, creates a new book object, and stores it in a book object array
//A function which loops through the array and displays each book on the page
//Each book should have a button which allows you to remove the book from the library
  You will need to associate your DOM elements with the actual book objects in some way. One easy solution is giving them a data-attribute that corresponds to the index of the library array.
Each book should have a button to change its read status
  To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a book’s read status on your Book prototype instance.


function constructBookObject {
  Create a new book object;
  Store it in the bookObjects array;
}

function newBook {
  show bookCreationForm;
    This should show a dropdown dialog which prompts the user to enter details of the new book, including:
      Author
      Title
      Number of pages
      Read 0/1
      Published date
      Completion date
      //An optional cover image
    Take the entered dialog from the bookCreationForm and add it to the bookObjects array as a new bookObject
    Append the book to the end of the DOM
}

function drawBookDisplay {
  loop through the array and create a card for each book in the array. 
  add the cards to the DOM
    the cards should be aligned using flex
}

function deleteBook {
  Remove the book from the array and then remove it from the DOM
}

function toggleRead {
  toggle the book's read attribute and then update its display in the DOM
}
